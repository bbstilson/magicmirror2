## TODO

- decide if the `size` field is still needed on the Widget model.
  - it's used for the draggable widget display to give users an idea of the widget shape. maybe there's a better way?
- clean up `console.log`s in server/app code
- fix all TODOs (heh)
- calendar has a bug where it is on day 1 when you load it from the dashboard, but is the right date when you refresh.
