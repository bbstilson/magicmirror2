# Magic Mirror

It's one of those [magic mirrors](https://magicmirror.builders), but it would have been too easy to just use what a bunch of people have already made, so I made my own app thingy. I think it's pretty cool. Whatever. Leave me alone.

## Running locally

### Start the development server

```
yarn start
```

### Start the api-server

```
cd server
make start
```

After making changes to the server code, you can restart with the make command: `make restart`
